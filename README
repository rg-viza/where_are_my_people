Purpose: Enables updating a user location in drupal to show their location on a map. Designed to be used in conjunction with a Android
or iPhone app that POSTs longitude and latitude at your drupal server's REST API (instructions below) to update a user's location

Android app coming soon (or possibly a link to an existing android app)!

Step 1: Create new google maps API key at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and add it to templates/map.html.twig template replacing YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY string with your key
Step 2: git clone to ../modules/custom directory under web root of drupal
Step 3: Enable "Where are my people?,  REST UI, RESTful Web services and Serialization modules in Drupal 8
Step 4: Go to Configuration | Rest UI and enable API Routes. Select all checkboxes.
Step 5: Point location app at your server and send a json payload via POST such as:
{
  "username":"admin",
  "long":-86.5537833,
  "lat":29.283338
}
To http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people?_format=json

IMPORTANT : 
You will need to send the following headers along with JSON payload:
X-CSRF-Token: [valid session ID]
Content-Type: application/json

If your server requires it, you may also need to send:
Authorization: Basic [some auth hash] 

as well.

Enjoy!
