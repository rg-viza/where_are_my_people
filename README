To Do: figure out Drupal 8's DIC, properly inject my dependencies, and get rid of that embarrasing hack I used as a bandaid for my lack of knowledge of Symfony's DIC

News: moved user object access to a proper repository service, and implemented  the service in the controllers. 
Now we're true MVC. While the module is built in true MVC fashion now, the dependency injection isn't plumbed correctly. 
The repository *can be injected, I just haven't sat down to learn the symfony/drupal 8 DIC. Tomorrow! I've only
been doing dependency injection for the last year and a half and haven't yet learned this particular container. Not a major
knowledge gap. I'm confident I'll nail it tomorrow... Today was learning how to register drupal 8 services and writing the
repository code.Baby steps... 

On another front, I registered my domain name today. I got davisneilp.com :-) 99 cent domain reg sale at go-daddy :-)

README
Warning: I built this by day 4 of learning Drupal 8. I have Drupal 6/7 experience but Drupal 8 is a whole lot different, as far as coding goes :-) 

Purpose: Enables updating a user location in drupal to show their location on a map. Designed to be used in conjunction with a Android or iPhone app that POSTs longitude and latitude at your drupal server's REST API (instructions below) to update a user's location

Android app coming soon (or possibly a link to an existing android app)!

Step 1: Create new google maps API key at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and add it to templates/map.html.twig template replacing YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY string with your key
Step 2: git clone to ../modules/custom directory under web root of drupal
Step 3: Enable "Where are my people?",  REST UI, RESTful Web services and Serialization modules in Drupal 8
Step 4: Go to Configuration | Rest UI and enable Where are my People? API Routes. Select all checkboxes.
Step 5: Point location app at your server and send a json payload via POST such as:
{
  "username":"admin",
  "long":-86.5537833,
  "lat":29.283338
}
To http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people?_format=json

IMPORTANT : 
You will need to send the following headers along with JSON payload:
X-CSRF-Token: [valid session ID]
Content-Type: application/json

If your server requires it, you may also need to send:
Authorization: Basic [some auth hash] 

as well.

To see location of users use the following new route defined by this module:
http://[www.yoursever.com]i/where_they_are/admin for example

(Route is http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_they_are/{username})

I have also included a REST API call for getting a user's location, in case you want to integrate this location data into another application(or even your own modules, such as a tracking log!):
http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people/{drupal username}?_format=json
example:
http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people/admin?_format=json

returns:
{
	"location":{
		"longitude":[
			{
				"value": "-76.5537833"
			}
		],
		"latitude":[
			{
				"value": "39.2833380"
			}
		]
	}
}

Enjoy!
