To Do: Android app -- in progress

News: Straightened out the dependency injection, cleaned things up. 

README
Warning: I built this by day 4 of learning Drupal 8. I have Drupal 6/7 experience but Drupal 8 is a whole lot different, as far as coding goes :-) 

Purpose: Enables updating a user location in drupal to show their location on a map. Designed to be used in conjunction with a Android or iPhone app that POSTs longitude and latitude at your drupal server's REST API (instructions below) to update a user's location

Android app coming soon (or possibly a link to an existing android app)!

Step 1: Create new google maps API key at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials and add it to templates/map.html.twig template replacing YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY string with your key
Step 2: git clone to ../modules/custom directory under web root of drupal
Step 3: Enable "Where are my people?",  REST UI, RESTful Web services and Serialization modules in Drupal 8
Step 4: Go to Configuration | Rest UI and enable Where are my People? API Routes. Select all checkboxes.
Step 5: Point location app at your server and send a json payload via POST such as:
{
  "username":"admin",
  "long":-86.5537833,
  "lat":29.283338
}
To http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people?_format=json

IMPORTANT : 
You will need to send the following headers along with JSON payload:
X-CSRF-Token: [valid session ID]
Content-Type: application/json

If your server requires it, you may also need to send:
Authorization: Basic [some auth hash] 

as well.

To see location of users use the following new route defined by this module:
http://[www.yoursever.com]i/where_they_are/admin for example

(Route is http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_they_are/{username})

I have also included a REST API call for getting a user's location, in case you want to integrate this location data into another application(or even your own modules, such as a tracking log!):
http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people/{drupal username}?_format=json
example:
http://[www.yoursever.com]/where_are_my_people/admin?_format=json

returns:
{
	"location":{
		"longitude":[
			{
				"value": "-76.5537833"
			}
		],
		"latitude":[
			{
				"value": "39.2833380"
			}
		]
	}
}

Enjoy!
